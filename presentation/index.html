# Component Styling Landscape

---

# Agenda

Same todo list styled 6 different ways.

<img src="./images/styled todo list.png" alt="styled todo list" width="200">
<img src="./images/unstyled todo list.png" alt="unstyled todo list" width="400">

---

# Inline styles

Add style props directly to components or use `<style>` tags to write CSS rules.

## Pros

- Styles are co-located with component.

## Cons

- No style re-use
- Forces CSS to perform some style re-calculation when updating DOM with elements with style attributes
- Can't use pseudo-selectors and other CSS features

---

# External stylesheets

Write separate `.css` files and link them in HTML or import into JS files to create `<style>` tags with the help of a bundler.

## Pros

- Cache control. Browser caching can be optimized independently because it is a separate file.
- Separation of concerns?

## Cons

- Downloading doesn't start until after the main page has already been downloaded. We could create lots of CSS files but downloading them all is bad for page load time.
- Styles are not co-located, they are in a separate file but can still be alongside the component.
- Syntax of importing styles and applying to className feels redundant 95% of the time.

---

# CSS modules

Creates CSS rules that can be imported in JS producing 'mangled' class names that are scoped to the component.

## Pros

- Local scoping
- Compose keyword and other features

## Cons

- Can't locally scope regular tag selectors like `p {}`
- Styles are not co-located.

---

# SASS modules

## Pros

- Nested selectors arguably provide better readability.
- Many other powerful features.

## Cons

- Steeper learning curve for devs.

---

# Utility classes

## Pros

- Forces consistency with design system.
- Encourages breaking up components for style re-use.
- Efficient, avoids duplication so minimal set of possible css rules are used.
- Saves time solving common problems. The `divide` class was helpful to separate todo items.
- Layers and other features.
- Can use JS variables in styles.

## Cons

- Steeper learning curve for devs. Need to learn all the utility classes.
- Looks ugly to some.
- Unchecking a style in the browsers dev console removes it everywhere which makes debugging slightly more annoying.

---

# CSS-in-JS

# Pros

- Styles are co-located with component.
- Local scoping.
- Can use JS variables in styles.

# Cons

- Requires runtime dependencies which bloats bundle.
- Performance overhead.
- Problems with SSR.
- Have to add a weird hint for Babel.
- Looks ugly to some.
- Clutters components tree.

---

# Conclusion

Use utility classes and extract components for style re-use.

If there is something you can't do nicely with utility classes then use CSS/SASS/SCSS modules.
